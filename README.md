# 2D Game for Open Day at FAI

This project is created in the Godot 4.2 open-source engine and is aimed at creating a simple 2D game for the Open Day 
at the Faculty of Applied Informatics on Thomas Bata University in Zlin.

## The use

1. Start the game in Godot Engine by clicking the "Play" button (F5).
2. The player is controlled using left and right arrow keys.
3. The goal of the game is to collect good items (book, chipset) and avoid bad items (bomb).

## Main files and folders

- `scenes/` - contains all game scenes (eg `book.tscn`, `bomb.tscn`, `chipset.tscn`, `Gameworld.tscn`, `GameOver.tscn`).
- `scripts/` - contains all scripts (eg `Gameworld.gd`).
- `assets/` - contains all resources such as images and sounds.

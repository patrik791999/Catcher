# Agile Plan

## Introduction
This agile plan outlines the development schedule for the Catcher game over four days. 
The project will be divided into four sprints, each focusing on different aspects of the game development process. 
Although the project will be completed individually, the plan is designed as if it were a team effort, adhering to agile methodologies.

## Sprint 1: Day 1 - Initial Setup and Basic Mechanics
### Goals:
- Set up the development environment with Godot Engine 4.2.
- Implement basic player movement.
- Create placeholder graphics for the player, informatics items, and non-items.

### Tasks:
1. Install and configure Godot Engine 4.2.
2. Create a new project and set up the main scene.
3. Implement player character movement using arrow keys.
4. Design placeholder sprites for the player, informatics items, and non-items.
5. Test basic movement and sprite rendering.

### Expected Outcome:
- A functioning player character that can move left and right.
- Placeholder graphics visible in the game.

## Sprint 2: Day 2 - Item Mechanics and Game Loop
### Goals:
- Implement falling item mechanics.
- Create basic game loop including item spawning and catching.
- Add score tracking and life system.

### Tasks:
1. Implement item spawning system.
2. Create logic for items falling from the top of the screen.
3. Implement collision detection for catching items.
4. Add score tracking for correct items caught.
5. Implement life system (player starts with 3 lives, loses a life for incorrect item).

### Expected Outcome:
- Functioning game loop with falling items, score tracking, and life system.
- Player can catch correct items and avoid incorrect ones.

## Sprint 3: Day 3 - Graphics and Sound Integration
### Goals:
- Replace placeholder graphics with final graphics.
- Add sound effects and background music.
- Implement increasing difficulty (items fall more often over time).

### Tasks:
1. Create or source final graphics for player, informatics items, and non-items.
2. Integrate final graphics into the game.
3. Source and integrate sound effects for catching items and losing lives.
4. Add background music to the game.
5. Implement logic to increase item drop frequency over time.

### Expected Outcome:
- The game has final graphics and sound effects.
- The difficulty increases as the game progresses.

## Sprint 4: Day 4 - UI, Testing, and Polishing
### Goals:
- Implement game UI including main menu, score display, and game over screen.
- Conduct thorough testing and fix bugs.
- Polish gameplay and optimize performance.

### Tasks:
1. Create main menu with start, instructions, and exit options.
2. Implement in-game UI for displaying score and remaining lives.
3. Create game over screen with final score and option to restart.
4. Conduct thorough testing to identify and fix bugs.
5. Optimize game performance for smooth gameplay.
6. Finalize `readme.md` with instructions and project details.

### Expected Outcome:
- Fully functional game with complete UI.
- All known bugs fixed and gameplay polished.
- Ready for presentation and playtesting.

## Conclusion
By following this four-day agile plan, the development of Catcher will be structured and efficient, ensuring 
that all critical aspects of the game are addressed and completed within the short timeframe.
